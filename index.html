        Earth is our home planet. Scientists believe Earth and its moon formed
        around the same time as the rest of the solar system. They think that
        was about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth is the fifth-largest planet in
        the solar system. Its diameter is about 8,000 miles. And Earth is the
        third-closest planet to the sun. Its average distance from the sun is
        about 93 million miles. Only Mercury and Venus are closer. Earth has
        been called the "Goldilocks planet." In the story of "Goldilocks and the
        Three Bears," a little girl named Goldilocks liked everything just
        right. Her porridge couldn't be too hot or too cold. And her bed
        couldn't be too hard or too soft. On Earth, everything is just right for
        life to exist. It's warm, but not too warm. And it has water, but not
        too much water.From space, Earth looks like a blue marble with white
        swirls and areas of brown, yellow, green and white. The blue is water,
        which covers about 71 percent of Earth's surface. The white swirls are
        clouds. The areas of brown, yellow and green are land. And the areas of
        white are ice and snow.umans have known that Earth is round for more
        than 2,000 years! The ancient Greeks measured shadows during summer
        solstice and also calculated Earth's circumference. They used positions
        of stars and constellations to estimate distances on Earth. They could
        even see the planet's round shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse.
        (We still can see this during lunar eclipses.)At the equator, Earth
        spins at just over 1,000 miles per hour. Earth makes a full spin around
        its axis once every 24 hours, or one day. The axis is an imaginary line
        through the center of the planet from the North Pole to the South Pole.
        Rather than straight up and down, Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of
        23.5 degrees.
